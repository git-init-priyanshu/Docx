## How it works:

* You need to sign up with your email id and password.

* After signing up, you will be redirected to the home page where you can see all your documents. If you are a new user, this section will be empty, and you will need to create a new document.
  
* To create a new document, click the button on the top right corner.

* Edit your document as you like; changes will be saved automatically.

* You can share your document with others for collaboration. To do this, click on the 'Share Doc' button located under the thumbnail of each document on the home page.

* After clicking the button, send the link to your friend. They will paste the link, and both of you can then edit the same document simultaneously.
